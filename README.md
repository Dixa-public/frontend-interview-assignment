  <h3 align="center">Frontend Interview Assignment</h3>

  <p align="center">As part of our application process, we would like you to complete this assignment. It should take no more than a few hours.</p>
</div>

## About the assignment

The assignment is deliberately open-ended and meant to be a conversation starter for the technical
interview phase. There are no right or wrong answers here, we're looking
for something that's 100% you.

You have 2 options:

1. Create a new component that you would like us to review
   and discuss during the interview.
2. Improve an existing component by modifying it and
   documenting your changes.

### Things to keep in mind

- Consider the provided code more as a playground to get you started, feel free
  to add/adjust anything you think will show off your skills and
  knowledge in a best way.

- The provided components are not examples of complete or
  ideal components, therefore:

  - They could be improved on.
  - They could be commented on. It would be also great if
    comments question the way we do things or provide an
    alternative approach.
  - They could be a building block or an inspiration for
    creating a new custom component or feature.

## Setting up the project

### Requirements

- [Node 18](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn 3](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Instructions

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/Dixa-public/frontend-interview-assignment/generate)
   to create a **private repo** in your personal GitHub
   account.
2. Run
   `git clone git@github.com:{USERNAME}/frontend-interview-assignment.git`
   to clone the repo.
3. Open the project directory with
   `cd frontend-interview-assignment`.
4. Run `yarn i` command to install the dependencies.
5. Run `yarn sb` to start Storybook.

> DO NOT fork this template repository or create Pull
> Requests against it.
> [Use this template](https://github.com/Dixa-public/frontend-interview-assignment/generate)
> to create your own.

### Project structure

All of the components are placed in `src/components/`
directory, along with their respective Storybook stories, although not all components are documented.

Currently the `Icon` component internally uses free
`font-awesome` icons. Please see the
[list](https://fontawesome.com/icons?m=free) of expected
`name` values.

### Contribution guidelines

There are no strict contribution guidelines for this
assignment, instead you are expected to showcase your
expertise in whatever way you see fit.

As a minimum however, code should be written in TypeScript
and be relatively well-typed, as well as components should
be documented in Storybook. We use CSS Modules for working
with CSS, and you can either choose to follow the same
approach, improve it, or replace it with your own preferred
solution, as long as you can demonstrate why your approach
is better.

## Submitting your solution

When you are ready for us to look at your solution, do the
following in **your repo**:

1. Create a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch. The
   solution must be implemented in a separate branch.
2. Add us as external contributors to your own private repo,
   so we can review your Pull Request.

When we are done, you, of course, own the code you made.
